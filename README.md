2. [x86 MySQL C Connector] (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-C/mysql-connector-c-6.1.5-win32.msi)
3. [x86 MySQL C++ Connector] (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-C++/mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3-win32.msi)
4. A MySQL Database 
5. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010


## Installation

### Compiling

Copy your everything from INSIDE your boost download boost download to Server/NtlDatabase/mysql/boost
When it looks like [this](http://puu.sh/a0q9o/946f96747f.png) it is correct.

Next in the NtlDatabase folder open mysql_wrapper.h and change the database credentials to your database credentials
(currently the stored procedures require the user to be root@% you can change them if you like)
 
Now open AKCore.sln with visual studio 2010.
Select the Debug/win32 configurations and compile.

Congrats you are done with this section
 
### SQL

Create a new database called dbo in your MySQL instance.

import the sql files from the SQL folder.

Create your first account by manually entering it in your database.

## Configuration

Now that you have everything compiled you can setup your server.

Go into the debug folder in the root directory (AKCore) 
There is one file to edit

Server.ini

All you have to do in here is set your ports and database information. If you don't want to that is fine as well.
This is an optional step.
