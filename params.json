[Boost 1.55.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.zip/download)\r\n2. [x86 MySQL C Connector] (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-C/mysql-connector-c-6.1.5-win32.msi)\r\n3. [x86 MySQL C++ Connector] (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-C++/mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3-win32.msi)\r\n4. A MySQL Database \r\n5. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Compiling\r\n\r\nCopy your everything from INSIDE your boost download boost download to Server/NtlDatabase/mysql/boost\r\nWhen it looks like [this](http://puu.sh/a0q9o/946f96747f.png) it is correct.\r\n\r\nNext in the NtlDatabase folder open mysql_wrapper.h and change the database credentials to your database credentials\r\n(currently the stored procedures require the user to be root@% you can change them if you like)\r\n \r\nNow open AKCore.sln with visual studio 2010.\r\nSelect the Debug/win32 configurations and compile.\r\n\r\nCongrats you are done with this section\r\n \r\n### SQL\r\n\r\nCreate a new database called dbo in your MySQL instance.\r\n\r\nimport the sql files from the SQL folder.\r\n\r\nCreate your first account by manually entering it in your database.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nNow that you have everything compiled you can setup your server.\r\n\r\nGo into the debug folder in the root directory (AKCore) \r\nthere are 4 files you can edit.\r\n\r\n1.

Submit a pull request\r\nWe will go over the code and if it complies with the coding standard we have set forth\r\nwe will put it in our next commit. This Git repo was made with you all in mind. Please\r\ncontribute to it, bug fixes, patches all of it,  without all of us, we won't be able to \r\nplay this awesome game again.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
